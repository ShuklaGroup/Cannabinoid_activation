#  Difference in Activation Mechanisms of Cannabinoid Receptors Regulates their Ligand Selectivity
This repository contains MSM feature file, final MSM object, codes and pdb structure files, and bootstrap samples used to genarate figures and
calculations in the manuscript.

## Main_Figure_3 
- CB1_feature_calculator.py: Python script to calculate the feature values for the conserved and unconserved features of CB1 pdb files
- CB2_feature_calculator.py: Python script to calculate the feature values for the conserved and unconserved features of CB2 pdb files  
- CB1_scatter_plot_maker.py: Python script to generate 1-D scatter plots to project the conserved and unconserved features of CB1
- CB2_scatter_plot_maker.py: Python script to generate 1-D scatter plots to project the conserved and unconserved features of CB2
- Separate Numpy files containing conserved and unserved feature values for different PDBs
- Experimentally determined PDB files in different conformational state

## Main_Figure_7
- CB1_affinity_bar_plot.py: Python script to generate the bar plots as shown in the Figure 7C.
- CB1_affinity_bar_plot.py: Python script to generate the bar plots of docking affinities of CB2 selective agonists (JWH-133, HU-308, JWH-015, AM1241) to CB1 metatable states (Inactive, active, I1, I2, I3, I4) as shown in the Figure 7C. 
- As mentioned in the manuscript, docking were performed on 100 structures on each metastable states. Resultant Docking Energy 

- CB2_affinity_bar_plot.py: Python script to generate the bar plots of docking affinities of CB2 selective agonists (JWH-133, HU-308, JWH-015, AM1241) to CB1 metatable states (Inactive, active, I1, I2) as shown in the Figure 7C.


## Main_Figure_8
